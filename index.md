## Self-Assessment

Under construction! Feel free to check back later.

## Chosen Artifact 

My artifact comes from the CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course at SNHU. In its simplest terms the project loads a bids csv file and can then do several small tasks such as display all of the data, find a predetermined item from the data, or delete the predetermined item from the data. However, none of the data is stored, and upon close, nothing is saved.
